## Motivation

As stated in the [last last post](/2021/04/23/a-gem-with-a-view.html), our goal package up a front end interface for [FactoryBot](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot) and distribute the functionality as a Ruby Gem. In the [last post]() we built the gem, leaving the details of the FactoryBot ~hacks~ hooks as a black box. Today we open that box. We'll find a fair amount of guessing and hackery in order to do what we want to with FactoryBot. It's gonna be fun!

## Quick Recap

When we left off, we had just built a gem that could be installed in a Rails app to provide a UI to FactoryBot simply by using

```ruby
mount FactoryBurgers::App, at: "/factory_burgers", as: "factory_burgers"
```

A user could then go to `localhost:3000/factory_burgers` (for a standard `rails s` startup) to view and use the UI. We didn't go over what the UI looked like or how the back end works. This post will focus on the back end, but let's start from the UI to make things easier to follow from the user perspective.

## A Sneak Peek at the UI

When a user navigates to `/factory_burgers`, they'll be greeted with a form:

{% include post_image.html name="form.png" width="700px" alt="Form with factories in a datalist dropdown" title="form"%}

This form allows the user to select from a list of FactoryBot factories to create an object. Once selected, the form dynamically creates checkboxes for each registered trait as well as model attributes.

{% include post_image.html name="traits_and_attributes.png" width="700px" alt="Form with trait checkboxes and attribute fields" title="traits_and_attributes"%}

The selections above are the UI equivalent of writing

```rb
FactoryBot.create :post, :long, title: "test_post_1"
```

Once the user hits "Gimme", the object is created and displayed. But we're not done! Now we go deeper. Using ActiveRecord introspection, we find the associations defined on the model (here, `Post`), then find the factories that are capable of building any of those associations, and allow the user to build out associated objects to the `Post` instance we just created.

{% include post_image.html name="object1.png" width="700px" alt="Object card representing the requested and built object" title="object1"%}

As the user builds out additional objects, they can select and of the objects already ordered to build out additional associations. When we're all done, we can have a look at everything we've done.

{% include post_image.html name="full_order.png" width="700px" alt="Object cards with all objects built" title="full_order"%}

So now that you have the User Journey, we'll spend the rest of this post going over

* How to use these factories in a non-test environment
* How to list all of the factories
* How to discover and expose traits, attributes, associations, and factories for these associations
* How to get around some issues when using FactoryBot outside a immediate tear-down test db environment (*cough* uniqueness validations *cough*).
* How to allow customization of the display such as you see above: different models display different summary attributes and can even have links to your application's show pages for these resources.

We won't cover the UI (React with very cool animations, thank you very much) or the controllers / middleware that connects the two. Most of the latter was covered in the last post. If you're looking for more context that is in this post, check out the [full codebase](https://github.com/ozydingo/factory_burgers).

## The Back End

### Prerequisites

The first prerequisite is to make sure you have FactoryBot enabled in your development environment. So make sure `factory_bot` is in your Gemfile and included in at least the `:development` (or equivalent) group and not just `:test`.

Next, we need to load the registered factories; we don't get this for free. But in Factory Bot 6.x, we can do this as easily as

```rb
def load_factories
  FactoryBot.reload
end
```

We'll call this from an initialization script, `init.rb`

```rb
require Pathname(__dir__).join("factory_bot_adapter.rb")

begin
  require "factory_bot"
rescue LoadError
  raise LoadError, "Could not load factory_bot. Please make sure it is installed."
end

FactoryBurgers::FactoryBotAdapter.load_factories
```

### Loose coupling

A lot of data and methods we're going to deal with will be specific to the version of FactoryBot in use. For example, in FactoryBot 4.0, `FactoryBot.factories` will give you a list of `FactoryBot::Factory` object. In 6.0, you would use `FactoryBot::Internal.factories`. In order to keep our middleware and view well oganized and robust, we'll abstract all of those relevant details into adapter classes. For this post, many of the floating methods you see defined end up living in `FactoryBurger::FactoryBotAdapter::FactoryBotV6`, which is the 6.x-specific adapter. This way, we can define entry point methods such as `FactoryBurgers.factories` without worrying about the version, effectively decoupling the consumer of our back-end code (the middleware) from the specific library and version powering the back-end.

## Listing Factories

Once we have the above, getting a list of factories using FactoryBot 6 is simply

```rb
def factories
  FactoryBot::Internal.factories
end
```

The return value is an Array of `FactoryBot::Factory` objects. We'll wrap that in our own data class for stability. For our purposes, that means providing access to the factory name, model attributes, and factory traits.

```rb
module FactoryBurgers
  module Models
    class Factory
      attr_reader :factory

      def initialize(factory)
        @factory = factory
      end

      def to_h
        {
          name: name,
          class_name: class_name,
          traits: traits.map(&:to_h),
          attributes: attributes.map(&:to_h),
        }
      end

      def to_json(*opts, &blk)
        to_h.to_json(*opts, &blk)
      end

      def name
        factory.name.to_s
      end

      def class_name
        build_class.base_class.name
      end

      def traits
        defined_traits.map { |trait| Trait.new(trait) }
      end

      def attributes
        settable_columns.map { |col| Attribute.new(col) }
      end

      private

      def build_class
        factory.build_class
      end

      def settable_columns
        factory.build_class.columns.reject { |col| col.name == build_class.primary_key }
      end

      def defined_traits
        factory.definition.defined_traits
      end
    end
  end
end
```

We'll do the same for traits and attributes. For attributes, we used `factory.build_class` to get the ActiveRecord class, then called `columns` to get its list of columns. Finally, we reject the primary key, since we don't want to allow the user to specify that in the UI. The data class is define as follows:

```rb
module FactoryBurgers
  module Models
    class Attribute
      attr_reader :column

      def initialize(column)
        @column = column
      end

      def to_h
        {name: name}
      end

      def to_json(*opts, &blk)
        to_h.to_json(*opts, &blk)
      end

      def name
        column.name
      end
    end
  end
end
```

To get traits for a factory, we used `factory.definition.defined_traits`, where `factory` is a `FactoryBot::Factory`, and the return value is an array of `FactoryBot::Trait`s. Our data class:

```rb
module FactoryBurgers
  module Models
    class Trait
      attr_reader :trait

      def initialize(trait)
        @trait = trait
      end

      def to_h
        {name: name}
      end

      def to_json(*opts, &blk)
        to_h.to_json(*opts, &blk)
      end

      def name
        trait.name
      end
    end
  end
end
```

Both of these are very basic classes whose single responsibility is to encapsulate factory, trait, and attribute information in a manner our middleware can reliably consume. Here's an example.

```rb
factory = FactoryBurgers::Introspection.factories.find { |f| f.name == :post }
pp FactoryBurgers::Models::Factory.new(factory).to_h

{:name=>"post",
 :class_name=>"Post",
 :traits=>[{:name=>"long"}, {:name=>"very_long"}],
 :attributes=>
  [{:name=>"created_at"},
   {:name=>"updated_at"},
   {:name=>"author_id"},
   {:name=>"title"},
   {:name=>"body"}]}
```

You can see how each of the items in this data structure map to the form inputs in the screenshots above.

When the form gets submitted, we use the factory, traits, and attribute data to build the object using `FactoryBurgers::Builder#build`:

```rb
def build(factory, traits, attributes)
  FactoryBot.create(factory, *traits, attributes)
end
```

This simply maps the data we parse and pass from the middleware to the `create` call you're likely already familiar with. If you're used to seeing `create` called without an explicit reference to `FactoryBot`, that's because you have some setup (such as `spec_helper.rb` in rspec) that defines these methods in your test's execution context. We don't have and don't wan't that, so we'll just call the method on `FactoryBot` explicitly.

### Customization

The next cool feature we'll build into the gem is the ability to customize what information we display for each built object. Notice how our "User" object UI above had a number of useful attributes on display, but "Comment" had only the id. We don't want to overwhelm the user with _all_ attributes of a given object, but we do want to provide any information the developer deems useful.

Our strategy will be to use customizeable presenters. We'll construct a presenter base class that application developers can subclass, exactly as Rails provides the base class `ActiveRecord::Base` that can be subclassed. We'll allow application developers to define their presenters using one of two forms:

1. Create a class and reference it explicitly

    ```rb
    FactoryBurgers::Presenters.present "User", with: FactoryBurgers::Presenters::UserPresenter
    ```

2. Use an anonymous presenter defined inline

    ```rb
    FactoryBurgers::Presenters.present("Post") do
      attributes do |post|
        {
          id: post.id,
          author_id: post.author_id,
          word_ccount: post.body.split(/\s+/).count,
        }
      end

      link_path { |post| Rails.application.routes.url_helpers.post_path(post) }
    end
    ```

Let's start by looking at the base presenter class. Two methods, `attributes` and `link_path`, can be overwritten in subclasses to provide information about what attributes to display, and what if any HTML link to show on the object.

```rb
module FactoryBurgers
  module Presenters
    class Base
      class << self
        def presents(name)
          define_method(name) { object }
        end
      end

      attr_reader :object

      def initialize(object)
        @object = object
      end

      def type
        object.class.name
      end

      def attributes
        object.attributes.slice("id", "name")
      end

      def link_path
        nil
      end
    end
  end
end
```

And an example subclass implementation for `FactoryBurgers::Presenters::UserPresenter` that overrides both `attributes` and `link_path`:

```rb
class FactoryBurgers::Presenters::UserPresenter < FactoryBurgers::Presenters::Base
  presents :user

  def attributes
    {
      id: user.id,
      name: user.full_name,
      login: user.login,
      email: user.email,
    }
  end

  def link_path
    Rails.application.routes.url_helpers.user_path(user)
  end
end
```

The id, name, login, and email attributes are displayed on the UI. We tell FactoryBurgers to use this presenter by putting the following in an initializer file, such as `/config/initializers/factory_burgers.rb`:

```rb
FactoryBurgers::Presenters.present "User", with: FactoryBurgers::Presenters::UserPresenter
```

{% include post_image.html name="user.png" width="250px" alt="Card with user attributes and an external link" title="user object"%}

Notice the link icon next to the title "User"? That uses the `link_path` method we defined. Nice.

We also showed an anonymous presenter using `FactoryBurgers::Presenters.present("Post") do ... end`. How does this work? At a high level, we use the provided blocks to build an anonymous subclass of `FactoryBurgers::Presenters::Base`, and use that subclass identically to what we described above.

In order to do this, we'll create a builder class. Here's how it will be called from the `present` method (now would be a good time to review Ruby blocks if you're fuzzy on them!)

```rb
def present(klass, with: nil, &blk)
  presenter = with || build_presenter(klass, &blk)
  @presenters[klass.to_s] = presenter
end

def build_presenter(klass, &blk)
  PresenterBuilder.new(klass).build(&blk)
end
```

So what does the `PresenterBuilder` actually look like? My go-to move for metapgramming with blocks is to inherit from `BasicObject` and define the methods you want developers to use inside the block. Simplified here, that's `attributes` and `link_path`. We also provide a `build` method. Note that we could be more strict and create a separate class for the block evaluation than the `build` method, for a simple DSL with fewer than five methods that was overkill.

```rb
module FactoryBurgers
  class PresenterBuilder < BasicObject
    def initialize(klass)
      @presenter = ::Class.new(::FactoryBurgers::Presenters::Base)
      @klass = klass
    end

    def build(&blk)
      instance_eval(&blk)
      return @presenter
    end

    def attributes(&blk)
      @presenter.define_method(:attributes) do
        blk.call(object)
      end
    end

    def link_path(&blk)
      @presenter.define_method(:link_path) do
        blk.call(object)
      end
    end

    # ... a few other methods including `presents` and `type` ...
  end
end
```

If this is a little too much meta-programming for you, don't worry about it too much. We're building a subclass of `FactoryBurgers::Presenters::Base` just as we did above. We're just doing it dynamically using code to write our new code, creating a class with `Class.new` and defining methods using `define_method`. Ruby is pretty awesome.

### Headaches

Building this gem, I encountered one major headache that threatened to render the gem unusable. When you use FactoryBot, you often define sequences. For example, if you have a uniqueness validation on `users.email`, you might define a sequence `user_email` so that your first user created gets `somebody1@aol.com` and the next user gets `somebody2@aol.com`, and so on, so that your calls to `create` don't blow up for violating uniqueness.

The problem is that these sequences do not persist their state across server requests. In a test suite, you don't have to worry about server requests, and your sequences work as expected. In development, when you send one request that calls `FactoryBot.create :user`, then send another request from another browser click, the sequence starts from scratch and it blows up.

I came up with a quick and dirty solution, then a better but more manual solution. First, the quick and dirty:

```rb
def build(factory, traits, attributes)
  resource = insistently do
    FactoryBot.create(factory, *traits, attributes)
  end
  return resource
end

def insistently(tries = 30)
  tries.times do |attempt|
    return yield
  rescue ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid
    raise if attempt >= tries - 1
  end
end
```

Basically, if you get a invalid record, just try again. The sequence will increment by one, and eventually you'll get a valid record. Yeah, dirty.

There's a craftier solution, but it's a bit involved and so will be the subject of a [separate post](/2021/08/14/hacking-factories-part-2.html).

## Wrapping Up (for now)

In this post, we described:

* How we want our UI to function to allow interaction with FactoryBot
* How to use FactoryBot to discover factories and traits so that we can expose this information to a UI
* A strategy to decouple our middleware and UI from the specific internals of FactoryBot
* An approach to easily customizing the display of various factories and objects using a base presenter class developer can inherit from
* Some cool Ruby metaprogramming to make defining presenters even more convenient

Stay tuned to get even deeper into FactoryBot hackery where we find ourselves holding our breath and diving into non-exposed instance variables in order to work around the sequence x uniqueness validation problem!
